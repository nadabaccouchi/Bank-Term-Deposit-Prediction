Bank Term Deposit Prediction

Description:
This project predicts whether bank clients will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and marketing campaign data. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature encoding, outlier handling, and visualization. A Decision Tree model was trained and evaluated, achieving ~94% accuracy.

Technologies & Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with numerical and categorical features
Outlier detection and handling
Correlation analysis and heatmap visualization
Decision Tree modeling with Gini and Entropy criteria
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Usage:

Load the dataset (bank-additional-full.csv)
Run the notebook to reproduce preprocessing, visualization, and modeling
Use the trained model to predict deposit subscription for new clients
